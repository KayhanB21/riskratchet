# Changelog

All notable changes to `riskratchet` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

JSON-output stability policy (see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)): field names
in `scan --json`, `check --json`, and the baseline file are stable within
a minor version. Additive changes (new optional fields) may land in any
release; renames or removals are called out below under **Breaking**.

## [0.2.12] - unreleased

0.2.12 is the "experimental TypeScript discovery + contract docs" release. It pulls
TypeScript slice 2 (P20) forward — the first capability to actually look at TypeScript —
and closes the remaining SARIF/config contract-doc gaps (P17/P18). Python-only installs
are unchanged: tree-sitter ships only in the new optional `typescript` extra, the Python
analyzer and scoring are byte-for-byte unchanged, and no weight or threshold moved.

### Added

- (P20) **Experimental TypeScript function discovery** behind `scan
  --experimental-typescript` — informational only (no scoring, no coverage, no baseline,
  no gating; does not affect the exit code). It lists discovered `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts`
  functions (top-level functions, class methods — including on abstract and anonymous
  default-export classes — and named arrow/function expressions; React components fall out
  as exported functions/arrows) with their qualname, public/internal surface, and line span.
  Qualnames reflect nesting through classes, functions, and `namespace`/`module` blocks, so
  a namespaced `Foo.bar` does not collide with a top-level `bar`. Public/internal is export
  reachability — inline `export`/`export default` **and** separate `export { name }` clauses.
  Files with syntax errors are skipped with a warning (never partially listed). Anonymous
  inline callbacks, object-literal methods, interface/abstract method signatures, and
  generated files (a comment-anchored `@generated` header or `*.pb.ts`/`*.gen.ts` name) are
  skipped; generator functions and async iterators are not yet supported. The listing prints
  to **stderr** (an experimental diagnostic), so `--json`/`--format sarif`/`--output` stay
  valid with the flag on; output format may change and JSON/SARIF integration is deferred to
  a later slice.
- (P20) Optional `typescript` extra: `pip install 'riskratchet[typescript]'` pulls in
  `tree-sitter` + `tree-sitter-typescript` (version-capped — `tree-sitter-typescript<0.24` —
  so a transitive lock refresh can't silently swap in a grammar whose node taxonomy the
  discovery tests assert against). A default Python-only install resolves exactly as before —
  tree-sitter is imported lazily, only on the experimental path, with a clear install hint if
  absent.

### Docs

- (P17) Documented the SARIF output contract divergence from cargo-crap explicitly:
  riskratchet always emits a schema-valid SARIF 2.1.0 document (empty `results` when the
  gate is green) rather than rejecting `baseline + sarif`. Added a `diff --format sarif`
  clean-baseline empty-results test for parity with the existing `check` test.
- (P18) Documented `riskratchet config validate` as a one-line opt-in CI strict gate (exit
  2 on unknown keys / malformed config) in the README and AGENTS.md, complementing the
  warn-by-default behavior.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-06-13

0.2.11 is the "TypeScript groundwork" release (P19). It opens the first seam for a
future TypeScript backend — a language-backend contract, a parser-strategy
decision, a static TSX fixture corpus, and one additive JSON field — **without
shipping any TypeScript scoring**. Python remains the only stable backend;
Python-only installs are unchanged (no Node dependency, same runtime dependency
closure as 0.2.10). Scoring, weights, and thresholds are byte-for-byte unchanged.

### Added

- (P19) Additive `function.language` field in `scan --json` and `explain --json`,
  always `"python"` today (declared as `{ "const": "python" }` in
  `schemas/report.schema.json` and `schemas/explain.schema.json`). It future-proofs
  the per-function payload for a `"typescript"` value; existing consumers are
  unaffected. The baseline file, SARIF, and the check/diff payloads do **not** carry
  it yet — they gain it only when TypeScript scoring ships.

### Docs

- (P19) `docs/language-backend-contract.md` — the language-neutral contract a backend
  must fill (function discovery, coverage mapping, complexity, public surface,
  function identity), with the Python implementation as the reference and the
  TypeScript open questions per area.
- (P19) `docs/typescript-parser-decision.md` — parser strategy: **tree-sitter** as an
  optional `riskratchet[typescript]` extra (no Node runtime for Python-only users),
  with the Node-backed and regex alternatives rejected and the rationale recorded.
- (P19) TSX fixture corpus under `tests/fixtures/typescript/` (top-level functions,
  class/interface methods, arrow functions, React components with hooks, default
  exports, generated-code exclusion). Checked in as a static spec for the future
  discovery slice; not exercised by gate tests.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-06-07

0.2.10 is the "supply-chain trust and calibration" release. It makes release
provenance inspectable and turns the P24 corpus tooling into a standing empirical
calibration harness — phase 1 (PR replay) plus phase 2 (SZZ defect-linking and a
predictive-validity study across 34 OSS repositories). No native payload field was
renamed or removed; scoring is byte-for-byte unchanged from 0.2.9.

### Added

- (P14) Release builds now publish supply-chain provenance. The `publish.yml`
  build job generates a CycloneDX SBOM from the declared runtime dependency
  closure (uploaded as a separate `sbom` artifact) and — the genuinely new
  control — attaches a **GitHub build-provenance attestation** to the wheel and
  sdist (`actions/attest-build-provenance`), verifiable offline with
  `gh attestation verify`. The PyPI upload's PEP 740 attestations were already
  on by default under Trusted Publishing; the workflow now sets `attestations:
  true` explicitly so the requirement is visible and survives a default change.
  See `docs/threat-model.md` for how to fetch and verify each.

### Research

- (P21) Empirical calibration harness, phase 1, under `bin/calibration/`. It
  promotes the P24 corpus tooling into a reusable harness: a per-repo corpus config
  (`data/calibration/repos/<name>/repo.toml`), PR replay with per-revision coverage (checkout
  + the repo's own suite under coverage, cached per SHA), an in-process regression
  diff (head vs base) reusing the engine's `baseline_from_report` / `diff`, and
  candidate re-scoring of the `sprawl` component against hand-labelled PR outcomes.
  The three candidates from the P24 finding — drop the file-line term, shrink its
  share, raise the 500/1000 band — are evaluated by **recomputing the component**
  (not via weight overrides, since the file-line term lives inside the blended
  sprawl score) and measuring accept/reject separation. Analysis only: **no scoring
  weight or threshold changes in this release.** Populating the rollups is a
  human-run step (see `data/calibration/README.md`); the committed rollups start
  empty.

- (P21) Empirical calibration harness, phase 2 — SZZ defect-linking + predictive
  validity, under `bin/calibration/` (`szz.py`, `fixes.py`, `defects.py`,
  `predict.py`, `git_checkout.py`). Replaces phase 1's weak hand-labelled
  accept/reject proxy with a mined outcome label: the `defects` subcommand scores
  every function at a historical snapshot, mines bug-fix commits, `git blame`s
  their deleted lines to the introducing function (reusing riskratchet's diff
  parsing, `parse_file`, and `match_rename`), and tracks it back to the snapshot;
  the `predict` subcommand reports, per sprawl candidate, the AUC of the score
  against that defect label (AUC derived from the existing `mann_whitney_u`, no new
  stats). The readout answers whether the file-line sprawl term helps or hurts
  defect prediction. Analysis only — **no scoring change**. Ships a real,
  SHA-pinned snapshot: per-function defect labels and per-candidate AUCs for **34
  enabled repos** (general libraries + a pycaret-adjacent ML cohort), each run twice
  to confirm reproducibility (labels identical on all 34, scores byte-identical on
  26). The directional finding — the score is not a reliable defect predictor on the
  largest repos, and the file-line sprawl term is net-negative on average — is
  written up in `data/calibration/defect-prediction-findings.md`; it argues *against*
  a weight change, which is why none ships.

- (P21) Empirical calibration harness, phase 3 — the pooled, repo-stratified
  logistic-regression ablation that phase 2's write-up (§6.6/§7) named as the
  decision-gate, under `bin/calibration/ablation.py` (`harness ablate` →
  `data/calibration/ablation.json`). An L2 logit with one regularized intercept per
  repo (absorbing the per-repo heterogeneity that makes a naïve pooled AUC
  meaningless), validated leave-one-repo-out, with `sprawl` split into its
  function-length and file-line halves so the file-line term gets its own coefficient.
  On the committed 34-repo / 33,490-function snapshot it **confirms the file-line
  sprawl term carries no defensible independent signal** (dropping it does not reduce
  pooled CV-AUC; sign-test p=0.024; coefficient 95% CI [−0.094, 0.248] spans zero) and
  reframes the headline: the *fitted* six-component model reaches ~0.69 within-repo
  CV-AUC even where the shipped fixed-weight score is anti-predictive, so the
  components carry signal that the current blend does not. Analysis only — **still no
  scoring change**; a 0.3.0 drop/shrink of the file-line term is now the
  model-supported front-runner, gated on the open construct / external-validity gaps.
  Uses scipy/numpy via a new **`calibration` dependency-group** — dev/research-only,
  **not** a runtime dependency (the published wheel's dependencies are unchanged).

## [0.2.9] - 2026-06-03

0.2.9 is the "structured diagnostics and privacy controls" release. It makes CI
failures debuggable without polluting stdout, lets closed-source adopters redact
identifiers from shared output, and carries a research finding on the `sprawl`
component. No native payload field was renamed or removed; non-redacted,
non-verbose output is byte-for-byte unchanged from 0.2.8.

### Added

- (P11) Structured diagnostics on `scan`, `baseline`, `check`, `diff`, and
  `explain`:
  - `--verbose` prints a small fixed set of run diagnostics to **stderr** —
    coverage source (single / map / auto, including whether the auto-coverage
    cache was reused or regenerated), git/churn settings, include/exclude/allow
    filter effects, the analysis tallies, and (for `check`/`diff`) the resolved
    baseline path and entry count.
  - `--debug-json` emits the same diagnostics as a schema-versioned JSON
    envelope to stderr; `--debug-json-file PATH` writes it to a file instead.
    The envelope is its own contract, validated against the new
    `schemas/debug.schema.json` (`version: 1`), independent of the native
    payload schemas.
  - Stdout stays payload-only regardless of either flag. When redaction is
    active, the diagnostics surfaces (the always-on banner, `--verbose`, and
    `--debug-json`) hash their path fields too, so `--private-comment` cannot
    leak paths through diagnostics.
  - Implementation note: these diagnostics are assembled at the CLI layer from
    the report fields and resolved config (not threaded through `analyze`), and
    the category set is deliberately small (~5). Git timing / commit counts were
    considered and intentionally left out until a real debugging need appears.
- (P12) Privacy-aware output redaction on `scan`, `check`, `diff`, and
  `explain`:
  - `--redact-paths` and `--redact-qualnames` replace source paths and function
    qualnames with deterministic hashes across every output format (table,
    markdown, PR comment, GitHub annotations, SARIF, and JSON), including
    inside `reason` strings so a matched-rename or ambiguous-rename note can't
    leak the original target.
  - `--private-comment` is a preset: redact paths + qualnames and suppress
    source links.
  - **Salt:** `--redact-salt TEXT`, then `RISKRATCHET_REDACT_SALT`, then
    `[tool.riskratchet] redact_salt`. When none is set, the salt is **derived
    from the commit** (`GITHUB_REPOSITORY`@`GITHUB_SHA`, else `git rev-parse
    HEAD`); only when there is no salt source at all does riskratchet warn that
    the hashes are guessable. Consequence: hashes are deterministic within a
    commit (scan/check/diff in one CI run correlate) and intentionally
    unlinkable across commits and repositories. An explicit salt overrides this.
  - Redaction is an output transform applied after baseline matching, so the
    ratchet decision (regressions, exit code, MOVED matches) is **invariant**:
    a redacted run gates identically to an un-redacted one. The persisted
    baseline file is never redacted — the `baseline` command does not accept
    redaction flags.

### Research

- (P24) Sprawl-component validation. A reproducible multi-repo experiment
  (`bin/experiments/sprawl_vs_complexity.py --clone`; rolled-up results in
  `data/calibration/sprawl-experiment.json`) over ~3,900 functions in 4 repos
  (riskratchet, requests, httpx, rich) finds the per-file `sprawl` component is
  **near-orthogonal** to `structural_complexity` (pooled Spearman ≈ 0.07) — it
  measures size, not branching — and that its function-length half fires for
  only ~1% of functions, so in practice sprawl is the *file-line* term: a
  file-level property that shifts a function's score by up to 5 points on file
  size alone. Engaging the literature (El Emam et al. 2001 on size as a
  confound; Fenton & Neil 1999; Lanza & Marinescu 2006 on God-Class
  thresholds), the finding (`docs/sprawl-component-finding.md`) judges this a
  real but file-level signal whose maintainability validity is unproven, and
  **not unambiguous enough** to retune in a patch release. No weight or scoring
  change ships in 0.2.9; the question, with concrete candidate fixes, feeds the
  P21 calibration thread. (This corrects an earlier single-repo pass that
  reported a misleadingly high r≈0.28 using Pearson on saturated data.)

### Changed

- The dogfood baseline (`.riskratchet.json`) was regenerated. The diagnostics +
  redaction wiring grew `cli.py`, which raised the `sprawl` file-line term for
  the functions in it — itself a live instance of the P24 artifact above. Cheap
  simplifications were applied first (helper extraction); the residual bump is
  the file-size sprawl effect, not genuine added complexity. `cli.py` keeps
  growing each release; splitting it is deferred (working-rule #3) but noted as
  recurring tension.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-05-30

0.2.8 is the "first 5 minutes + adoption surface + PR review" release.
Three sub-themes:
1. **First 5 minutes** — `init`, `doctor`, zero-flag `scan` UX, and
   remediation-form setup errors so a fresh user gets value without
   reading docs.
2. **Adoption surface** — reusable GitHub Action (root `action.yml`)
   + `--fail-above N` no-baseline gate so a stranger can try
   riskratchet on a public repo without committing to a baseline.
3. **PR review** — PR-comment renderer parity, `explain --json`,
   and source-link parity (every JSON renderer + SARIF + the table
   footer) so review surfaces share one envelope shape.

### Added

- (P13) `riskratchet doctor` — six setup checks (paths, baseline,
  coverage + freshness, git, config, suppressions) reported as a
  colored text table on stdout with copy-pasteable remediation on
  stderr. Exit `0` only when every check is pass or warn; a single
  fail exits `1`. `--json` emits a structured envelope validated
  against `schemas/doctor.schema.json` (Draft 2020-12). New module
  `src/riskratchet/doctor.py` exposes `diagnose()`, `summarize()`,
  `DoctorCheck`, and `CheckStatus` for embedded use.
- (P15) `riskratchet init` — scaffolds a starter `[tool.riskratchet]`
  block in `pyproject.toml` (creates, appends, or no-ops based on
  existing content; `--force` replaces an existing block in place,
  intentionally dropping `[tool.riskratchet.*]` subtables). Detects
  the test runner (pytest / unittest / unknown) and prints a CI
  snippet pinned to the `ACTION_REF` release tag. New
  `--with-baseline` flag (and interactive TTY prompt when pytest is
  detected) runs `pytest --cov` + creates a baseline as part of
  `init`. `--no-snippet` suppresses the CI snippet for scripted
  use. The CI snippet SHA-pins `actions/checkout` to v4.2.2.
- (P25) Zero-flag `riskratchet scan` next-step footer — on default
  table format (no `--quiet`, no `--summary`, no `--output`, no
  baseline file), prints a stdout footer adapted to two axes:
  (a) whether `[tool.riskratchet]` exists (otherwise lead with
  `riskratchet init`) and (b) whether any function is at severity
  medium or higher (otherwise say "nothing to baseline yet"). All
  other formats / quiet modes are unchanged.
- (P26) Actionable setup errors — `Fix one of:` remediation blocks
  replace symptom-form messages for: **Missing coverage** (`baseline`
  / `check` / `diff`), **Stale coverage / auto-coverage produced
  nothing**, **No baseline**, **Malformed baseline**, **Missing
  scan path** (both CLI-argument and config-sourced). Setup errors
  stay on stderr; stdout payload contract is unchanged.
- (P27) Reusable GitHub Action — root `action.yml` (composite) so
  adopters can `uses: KayhanB21/riskratchet@v0.2.8` instead of
  copy-pasting the CI workflow. Inputs: `paths`, `coverage`,
  `baseline` (default `.riskratchet.json`), `fail-above` (default
  `60`, used when the baseline file is absent — wires to P28's
  no-baseline gate), `comment` (default `true`), `python-version`
  (default `3.12`), `riskratchet-version` (pin a PyPI release;
  default latest), `local-wheel` (install a local wheel; used by
  the dogfood workflow), `github-token` (default
  `${{ github.token }}`). Install path uses `astral-sh/setup-uv` +
  `uv tool install` (SHA-pinned). New
  `.github/workflows/dogfood-action.yml` builds the in-tree wheel
  and runs the local action against the riskratchet repo itself,
  satisfying the P27 "CI runs the action against a synthetic PR"
  acceptance criterion. The Marketplace wrapper repo
  `KayhanB21/riskratchet-action` shipped concurrently
  (`@v1` / `@v1.0.0`) and delegates to
  `KayhanB21/riskratchet@v0.2.8`; both shapes share `action.yml`
  as their source of truth.
- (P28) `check --fail-above N` — a no-baseline absolute-threshold
  gate. When `--fail-above` is given and no baseline resolves,
  every function whose current score strictly exceeds `N` is
  reported as a `kind: "above_threshold"` regression and `check`
  exits `1`. Configurable via `[tool.riskratchet] fail_above = N`
  (`(0, 100]`). New helper
  `riskratchet.baseline.regressions_above_threshold(report,
  threshold=N)` for embedding the gate without the CLI.
  `regressions.schema.json` `kind` enum additively gains
  `"above_threshold"`; `previous_score` and `delta` are `null`
  for that kind.
- (P8) PR-comment parity — `render_regressions_pr_comment` gains a
  one-line summary block (`**Regressions:** N · **New above
  threshold:** N · …`) so scan / check / diff PR comments read as
  the same family. `check --fail-above N --format pr-comment`
  (no-baseline mode) emits the regressions-only PR comment with
  the same `<!-- riskratchet-report -->` sticky marker, instead
  of exit `2` (this supersedes the P28 rejection-on-`pr-comment`
  behaviour shipped earlier in the cycle).
- (P9) `explain --json` and `explain --summary --json` — the
  previously text-only `explain` command emits a machine-readable
  envelope (`$schema`, `version`, `command`, body) matching the
  other JSON commands. `--json` alone returns the full function
  payload (same shape as a `scan --json` `functions[]` item);
  `--summary --json` returns the compact severity/score/crap
  block. New `schemas/explain.schema.json`; `summary.schema.json`
  `command` enum additively gains `"explain"`.
- (P10) Source-link parity — `--repo-url` / `--commit-ref` now
  thread through every output that lists functions:
  - **JSON renderers** (`scan --json`, `check --json`, `diff
    --json`, `explain --json`): payloads gain an optional
    `source_url` field with the standard
    `<repo>/blob/<ref>/<path>#L<start>-L<end>` shape.
  - **SARIF**: `properties.source_url` on each
    `riskratchet.function-risk` / `.regression` result. The rule-
    level `helpUri` continues to point at the project README.
  - **Table format**: a `Source:` footer below the table lists
    `{qualname:<40} {url}` lines for each row. Direct string
    writes (not Rich) so byte-stable snapshots are preserved.
  All four JSON schemas (`report`, `regressions`, `diff`,
  `explain`) add the optional field; existing consumers are
  unaffected.

### Changed

- (P10) `SourceLinks` moved from `riskratchet.reporting.markdown`
  to `riskratchet.reporting.summary` (the leaf) so the JSON / SARIF
  / text families can use it without violating the family-isolation
  rule. Re-exported from `riskratchet.reporting` — no public API
  break.
- (P26 / refactor) `riskratchet.config._resolved_paths` is now pure
  resolution: it returns paths and never exits. The existence check
  moved to a new `cli._check_paths_exist` helper called from every
  scanning command body. `config show` (inspection-only) skips the
  check by design. Restores `config.py` as a non-CLI module.
- (P28) `check` no longer hard-requires `--baseline`: with
  `--fail-above` and no baseline resolved, `check` runs in
  no-baseline mode. Both flags together: baseline gate is
  authoritative, `--fail-above` is ignored with a stderr warning.
- (P28) `check --summary` text output adds an `above_threshold=N`
  field to the per-kind summary line for parity with the JSON
  `by_kind` map. Additive; no field rename or removal.
- (P8) The composite action (`action.yml`) uses `--format
  pr-comment` in both modes; the no-baseline branch no longer
  prepends the sticky marker manually because `check` emits it
  itself.
- (P13) `doctor` remediations (the `→ fix:` lines) go to stderr so
  `doctor 2>/dev/null` filters to the status table and
  `doctor >/dev/null` filters to the actionable commands. Matches
  the P13 acceptance criterion.
- (P13) `doctor --json` omits the `remediation` field when null.
  Schema allows the omission (not in `required`); existing
  consumers handling either value are unaffected.
- `.riskratchet.json` regenerated 4× across the cycle to track
  intent-aligned scoring drift (new `--fail-above` branching,
  P25 footer, P26 setup-error helpers, source-link threading in
  reporting/text.py and the new `init`-side baseline runner). No
  baseline-relative behavior change for users not opting into the
  new flags.

### Removed

- (cleanup) Unused `CHECK_NAMES` tuple in `src/riskratchet/doctor.py`.
- (cleanup) Unused `InitResult` dataclass in
  `src/riskratchet/init.py`.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Config discovery: when `--config` is not given, riskratchet walks
  upward from the current directory for the nearest `pyproject.toml`
  containing `[tool.riskratchet]` and anchors to it. Relative `paths`,
  `coverage`, `coverage_map`, `coverage_cache`, and `baseline` values
  from that config resolve against the config file's directory, so
  running from a nested package directory produces the same result as
  running from the project root. `--config` still overrides discovery,
  and an explicit `--coverage` / positional paths stay relative to the
  current directory. When no `[tool.riskratchet]` ancestor exists,
  discovery falls back silently to the current directory. With
  `[tool.riskratchet]` present at multiple levels, the nearest one
  (walking up from the cwd) wins. The auto-coverage test command also
  runs from the config directory so it measures the whole project, and a
  no-arg invocation scans the current directory rather than the entire
  project rooted at the config dir.
- Unknown-key warning: `scan`, `baseline`, `check`, `diff`, and
  `explain` print a stderr warning when `[tool.riskratchet]` contains an
  unrecognized key (e.g. a typo like `fail_new_abvoe`) instead of
  silently ignoring it. The command still runs (exit 0); use
  `riskratchet config validate` for the strict (exit 2) gate. Stdout
  stays payload-only.
- A `pyproject.toml` that exists but fails to parse warns on stderr
  during discovery and is skipped, instead of being silently passed over
  (which would let a broken local config quietly fall through to an
  ancestor's config).
- `tests/test_baseline_layering.py` enforces the new `baseline/` package
  layering rule via AST parsing: the family submodules
  (`compare`, `diff`, `regressions`) import only the `io` / `classify`
  leaves, never each other.

### Changed

- Internal: `riskratchet.baseline` is now a package
  (`src/riskratchet/baseline/__init__.py`) re-exporting submodules `io`
  (JSON load/save), `compare` (the `check` gate), `diff` (full
  comparison), `regressions` (diff → failing-regression projection), and
  `classify` (shared matching ladder + component-regression policy). All
  previous `from riskratchet.baseline import …` imports continue to
  work; the family layout is an implementation detail. No user-visible
  behavior change — `check` and `diff` outputs in every `--format` are
  byte-for-byte identical to `0.2.6` (pinned by the syrupy suite). The
  rename matcher stays in the top-level `riskratchet.matching` module
  (also used by `analysis`), so it is intentionally not part of this
  package.
- Running from a nested directory now discovers and anchors to an
  ancestor `[tool.riskratchet]` config (see Config discovery). Before,
  config was read only from the current directory, so a nested
  invocation silently used no config. Pass `--config` explicitly to
  restore the old cwd-only behavior. The auto-coverage test command now
  runs from the config directory for everyone (not just nested runs); a
  project run from its own root sees no change.
- Internal: config discovery, validation, anchoring, and value
  resolution moved out of `cli.py` into a new `src/riskratchet/config.py`
  module (`cli.py` keeps only command definitions and dispatch, per the
  AGENTS.md "thin CLI" rule). No CLI behavior change.
- `.riskratchet.json` regenerated to reflect the new file paths. Part of
  the score drop on moved functions is the per-file `sprawl` component
  (smaller files score lower) rather than a genuine maintainability win;
  validating whether `sprawl` overlaps `structural_complexity` is a
  calibration item (roadmap P21), not a weight change here.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Internal: `riskratchet.reporting` is now a package
  (`src/riskratchet/reporting/__init__.py`) re-exporting submodules
  `text`, `markdown`, `json_payload`, `sarif`, `annotations`, and
  `summary`. All previous `from riskratchet.reporting import …`
  imports continue to work; the family layout is an implementation
  detail. No user-visible behavior change — outputs in every
  `--format` are byte-for-byte identical to `0.2.5`.
- `.riskratchet.json` regenerated to reflect the new file paths.
  56 function definitions moved from `reporting.py` to the new
  submodules; bodies are unchanged. Score components also dropped
  for the moved functions because the file sprawl signal is
  per-file and the new submodules are roughly one-sixth the size
  of the old monolithic file.
- `reporting/text.py` deduplicates Rich Console construction via a
  shared `_make_buffered_console()` helper (replaces three
  copy-pasted call sites).

### Added

- `syrupy` adopted for snapshot testing (`>=4`, dev dependency).
  New `tests/test_reporting_snapshots.py` pins every
  `(command × format)` combination by invoking the real CLI through
  Typer's `CliRunner`, so the dispatch glue is covered alongside the
  renderers. Existing snapshot tests in `tests/test_cli_snapshots.py`
  and `tests/test_diff.py` migrated to syrupy (inline goldens
  replaced with `.ambr` snapshots under `tests/__snapshots__/`).
- `tests/test_reporting_layering.py` parses each submodule's AST
  and asserts the family-isolation rule: only `summary.py` is shared
  across `text`, `markdown`, `json_payload`, `sarif`, and
  `annotations`. Catches accidental cross-family imports.
- `tests/reporting_fixtures.py` consolidates the in-memory
  `RiskReport`/`Regression`/`DiffReport` builders previously
  duplicated across reporting tests, plus a `make_cli_project()`
  helper that drops a deterministic on-disk fixture (pyproject,
  source, coverage.json) for CliRunner-based snapshots.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Rename-aware baseline matching: `compare` and `diff` now recognize
  renamed/moved functions via a weighted multi-signal matcher (body
  fingerprint, signature fingerprint, path equality, qualname tail,
  component-vector proximity, score proximity). Unambiguous matches stay
  `MOVED`; multi-candidate matches surface as a new `AMBIGUOUS_RENAME`
  status that always gates so risk growth can't be silently masked.
- New `BaselineEntry.signature` (and per-function `FunctionRisk.signature`):
  a name- and location-stripped hash of arguments, decorators, and return
  annotation. Stored optionally in baseline JSON; old baselines without
  the field continue to load.
- Monorepo coverage support: `[tool.riskratchet.coverage_map]` table and
  repeatable `--coverage-map prefix=path` CLI flag on `scan`, `baseline`,
  `check`, and `diff`. Longest matching prefix wins. Mutually exclusive
  with the single `--coverage` path.
- Diagnostics banner: every command now emits one stderr line that names
  the resolved root, scan paths, and coverage source (single file or per-
  prefix map). Stdout stays payload-only.
- Top-risk dogfood report: `bin/dogfood-top-risk.sh` regenerates
  `docs/top-risk.md` and `docs/top-risk.json`. A new informational CI job
  uploads the markdown as a per-PR artifact.
- Baseline governance gate: `bin/check_baseline_rationale.py` plus the
  `.github/workflows/baseline-gate.yml` workflow fail a PR that mutates
  `.riskratchet.json` without a rationale heading, an inline
  `riskratchet-baseline-rationale:` line, the `baseline-approved` label,
  or a `[riskratchet-baseline-bypass]` commit-message token.
- `tests/fixtures/monorepo/` end-to-end fixture for the monorepo path.

### Changed

- `riskratchet scan`, `baseline`, `check`, and `diff` now treat the
  positional `paths` argument as optional; when omitted, paths are taken
  from `[tool.riskratchet] paths` (or default to `.`). Backwards
  compatible — existing invocations are unaffected.
- Diff JSON output gained additive per-entry fields `previous_targets`
  (array) and `match_confidence` (number/null), plus an `ambiguous_rename`
  count in the summary. Schema (`schemas/diff.schema.json`) updated.
- Diff PR-comment block now lists ambiguous renames in the visible
  (gating) section alongside regressions and new functions.
- `_diff_summary_line` always renders `**Ambiguous renames:** N` even
  when zero, matching the unconditional formatting of regressed / new /
  improved counts.
- `parse_rationale` in `bin/check_baseline_rationale.py` returns the
  full rationale body, not just the first line. The displayed gate
  message still abbreviates to 80 characters for readability.

### Internal

- New module `src/riskratchet/matching.py` houses `match_rename`,
  `signature_fingerprint`, and the documented similarity weights /
  threshold (kept separate from `baseline.py` to ease the 0.2.7 baseline
  split). Weights are provisional pending empirical calibration
  (roadmap P13).
- New private helper `_classify_against_baseline` in `baseline.py`
  encapsulates the exact-id → unique-fingerprint → weighted-rename
  matching ladder, consumed by both `compare` and `diff`. Brought both
  functions back near their pre-0.2.5 risk scores.
- `engine.analyze` accepts a `coverage_map` argument; `coverage_path` and
  `coverage_map` are mutually exclusive.
- `MultiCoverageData` in `coverage.py` shards `CoverageData` by repo-
  relative prefix with longest-prefix dispatch.
- New `tests/test_workflows_yaml.py` validates the new workflows
  structurally (shape, artifact upload, pin-to-SHA security posture).
- New monorepo end-to-end test verifies that per-package coverage shards
  do not bleed across packages (longest-prefix lookup is enforced).

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-25

### Changed

- Folded release artifact metadata, install smoke, and SARIF validation checks
  into `publish.yml` so tag publishes validate the built distributions before
  uploading to PyPI.
- Added `ruff format --check .` to CI and publish quality gates.
- Removed the separate manual `release-check.yml` workflow now that publish owns
  the release validation path.
- Cleaned up dependency-audit input generation so the exported requirements omit
  the editable local project entry.
- Improved regression table ergonomics so long function targets are not
  truncated in terminal output.
- Clarified new-function findings: "new" now explicitly means absent from the
  baseline, not necessarily changed in the current commit.

### Fixed

- Added direct tests around source-tree version fallback behavior and simplified
  the fallback path so the repo's own ratchet gate stays green without
  accepting avoidable risk into the baseline.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Fixed runtime version drift by deriving `riskratchet --version` and package
  `__version__` from installed package metadata, with a source-tree fallback
  for unusual uninstalled execution.
- Fixed the README logo URL so PyPI can render the project logo from the
  package long description.
- Hardened release checks so the package metadata version, CLI `--version`,
  built wheel metadata, and wheel README metadata are verified before release.

### Added

- Focused regression tests for diff-to-regression conversion, diff renderers,
  PR-comment rendering, and SARIF regression output before broader output-path
  refactors.
- Baseline governance guidance for PRs and documentation, plus a threat model
  for coverage, baseline, supply-chain, and information-leakage limits.
- Security automation with CodeQL scanning and a pinned dependency audit
  workflow.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Normalized `pr-comment` output. `scan --format pr-comment` now emits a
  sticky review body with summary, current findings, source links, and
  collapsed lower-priority rows. `check --format pr-comment` now renders the
  same multi-section diff body as `diff --format pr-comment` while preserving
  the existing failing-regression exit semantics and regression-only
  `check --json` contract.
- `--summary` on `scan`, `check`, and `diff`. Plain output is compact
  aggregate lines for CI parsers; `--summary --json` emits a schema-backed
  envelope with `$schema`, `version`, `command`, and `summary` only.
- Markdown/PR source links on `scan` and `check` via `--repo-url` and
  `--commit-ref`, with GitHub Actions defaults from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`,
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, and `GITHUB_SHA`.
- `[tool.riskratchet.groups]` package/workspace rollups. Functions and diff
  entries now include additive optional `group` fields in JSON, and summaries
  include group-level counts. Ungrouped entries are `null` in JSON and
  `ungrouped` in text/markdown.
- `riskratchet config validate` and `riskratchet config show --json`, plus
  `schemas/config.schema.json` and `schemas/summary.schema.json`.
- Test coverage for the new review ergonomics: PR-comment snapshots, summary
  text/JSON behavior, source-link flags and GitHub Actions defaults, group
  longest-prefix matching, config validation/show paths, and schema
  validation for report/diff/config/summary outputs.
- README documentation for SARIF's intentional contract: scan SARIF reports
  filtered current findings, while check/diff SARIF report failing
  regressions and clean runs keep a valid empty `results` array.

### Removed

- `scripts/publish.sh`. Releases now go through `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
  (PyPI Trusted Publishing via OIDC) — tag `vX.Y.Z`, push, done. The README
  "Release" section has been updated to match.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- `--churn-days N` flag on `scan`, `baseline`, `check`, `explain`, and
  `diff` (default `90`). Also configurable as `[tool.riskratchet]
  churn_window_days`. CLI value wins over config.
- `__all__`-aware `public_surface` classification. Module-level
  `__all__ = [...]` (static list/tuple of string literals) additively
  promotes top-level names to public — a leading-underscore class or
  function listed in `__all__` is now treated as part of the public
  surface. Omission never demotes. Dynamic `__all__` falls back to the
  qualname-based naming rule. See README "Components, in plain English"
  for the full semantics.
- `check` now prints a short hint to **stderr** when it exits with
  regressions, naming the two escape hatches: regenerate the baseline,
  or loosen `--no-component-regression-gate` /
  `--fail-component-regression-above`. The hint is conditional —
  option 2 only appears when at least one regression has `kind ==
  "component_regressed"`. Stdout stays clean for `--json` consumers.
- README "Use cases" section with four detailed scenarios (solo dev +
  AI agent, team gating PRs in CI, pre-commit hook for solo repo,
  investigating one function with `explain` + `diff`).
- README "Components, in plain English" subsection — one paragraph per
  component with a concrete numeric example, plus a worked total-score
  example.
- README pre-commit integration: new "uv / poetry projects" variant
  under Pattern A showing the all-`language: system` style this repo
  uses on itself, plus a "How pre-commit and riskratchet fit together"
  preamble explaining the stashing/venv interaction.
- GitHub Actions: new `riskratchet` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  that runs on every pull request, regenerates `coverage.json`, runs
  `check --format pr-comment`, and upserts a single sticky PR comment
  via the `<!-- riskratchet-report -->` marker. Job fails when
  regressions are detected.
- Strengthened scoring test suite: per-component boundary tests at
  saturation thresholds and severity-band edges, plus nine new
  hypothesis-driven property tests covering each of the six components
  (boundedness, saturation, monotonicity, private/public contracts).
- New `tests/fixtures/all_exports_focused/` end-to-end fixture
  exercising the `__all__` promotion path through `analyze()`.
- Configurable risk weights via `[tool.riskratchet.weights]` in
  `pyproject.toml`. Any subset of the six component keys may be
  overridden; remaining keys keep their default and the whole vector is
  renormalized so the total stays in `[0, 100]`. Unknown keys, negative
  values, or an all-zero table cause the CLI to exit `2`. See README
  "How risk is scored" for the defaults.
- README "Release" section pointing at `scripts/publish.sh` and
  describing GitHub Actions as the source of truth for package health.
- README "Local development" section now mirrors the exact command
  sequence CI runs, so local green and CI green mean the same thing.
- AGENTS.md notes that CI is the canonical check set.

- `--json` flag on `scan` and `check` as a shortcut for `--format json`.
- `--quiet` / `-q` flag on `scan` to suppress the trailing summary line
  for pipe-friendly use from CI and agents.
- JSON Schemas published under `schemas/`:
  `report.schema.json`, `regressions.schema.json`, `baseline.schema.json`.
  Validated against actual CLI output in `tests/test_schemas.py`.
- `AGENTS.md` documenting how AI coding agents should invoke the tool and
  what guarantees the output contract provides.
- README "Using riskratchet from an AI coding agent" section with
  one-shot, CI, and PR-comment recipes plus a common-mistakes list.
- `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` now defaults to
  `--no-auto-cov --allow-missing-coverage` so the published hook works in
  pre-commit's isolated environment (no pytest available by default). The
  README now documents two intentional integration patterns: pre-generate
  coverage in a separate hook, or use `language: system` to give riskratchet
  access to your pytest.
- AGENTS.md documents the SARIF 2.1.0 output contract, including the
  driver name and rule IDs (`riskratchet.function-risk`,
  `riskratchet.regression`).
- Auto-coverage: when no usable `coverage.json` is present, riskratchet
  runs the configured `[tool.riskratchet] test_command` (default
  `pytest --cov --cov-branch --cov-report=json:{output} -q`) and caches
  the result at `.riskratchet/coverage.json`. The cache is reused while
  no source `.py` file is newer. Disable with `--no-auto-cov` or
  `auto_coverage = false`. Override the cache path with
  `coverage_cache = "..."`. `.riskratchet/` is gitignored.

## [0.2.0]

- First documented release. CLI subcommands: `scan`, `baseline`, `check`,
  `explain`. Pytest plugin available via `--riskratchet`.
- Risk score combines coverage gap, structural complexity, branch gap,
  churn, public surface, and sprawl.
- Baseline file format version `1`.
